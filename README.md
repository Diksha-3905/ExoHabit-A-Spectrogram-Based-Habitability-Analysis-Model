> **"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known." – Carl Sagan**

**ExoHabit** is a cutting-edge machine learning project that explores the stars through the eyes of the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**. Our mission?  
To analyze the *spectrograms* of exoplanets and find the ones most similar to Earth — the potential **new homes** for life beyond our pale blue dot.

## 🌠 What Is ExoHabit?

The JWST is capturing light from planets hundreds of light-years away — and hidden in those light waves is the secret of **atmospheres**, **gases**, and maybe even **life**.

This project builds an **AI-powered system** to:
- 🔭 Read & compare exoplanet spectrograms with Earth’s
- 💡 Detect key life-supporting molecules (like O₂, CH₄, CO₂)
- 🧠 Use signal processing & ML to compute **habitability scores**
- 📊 Visualize spectral similarities with beautiful graphs

> Think of it as a **space explorer’s AI assistant**, built to find our next planetary neighbor 🌍➡️🪐

## 🧬 Key Features

🚀 **JWST-Compatible**  
Analyzes real or simulated spectrograms from the James Webb Space Telescope

🧠 **ML-Driven Habitability Estimation**  
Compares planetary atmospheric signals to Earth's biosignature using machine learning

🌌 **Custom Habitability Score**  
Calculates a 0–100% match based on chemical similarity, zone, and environmental factors

🪞 **Side-by-Side Spectrogram Visualization**  
Plot & compare exoplanet light curves with Earth’s

🎯 **Extensible**  
Add deep learning, real NASA datasets, or build a planetary discovery dashboard

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Python 3.11`
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `astropy`, `specutils`
- JWST/Mission Archive APIs (optional)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. 🛰️ JWST sends planetary spectrograms
2. 📊 We extract key peaks from the spectrum (O₂, CO₂, CH₄)
3. 🧠 Compare this data with Earth’s known atmospheric spectrum
4. 🔢 Return a **compatibility score**
5. 🌍 Identify the most Earth-like candidates in space

Sample Output

🧪 Habitability Score: 88.3%
✅ "This planet contains strong O₂ and CH₄ signatures, within the habitable zone. Compatible with Earth-like life."
