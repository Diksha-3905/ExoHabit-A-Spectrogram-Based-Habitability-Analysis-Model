# 🌍🚀 ExoHabit: Discover Earth 2.0 with AI 🪐

![header](https://i.gifer.com/embedded/download/7U6f.gif)

> **"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known." – Carl Sagan**

**ExoHabit** is a machine learning research project powered by data from the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**. It compares the **spectrograms** of distant exoplanets with Earth’s to predict their **habitability** — guiding humanity toward our next potential home in the stars.

## 🌠 What Is ExoHabit?

Using AI, ExoHabit helps:
- 🔬 Detect key molecules like O₂, CH₄, CO₂ in exoplanet atmospheres
- 🧠 Compare planetary spectrograms with Earth’s biosignature
- 🪐 Estimate the percentage of compatibility for human-like life
- 📈 Visualize spectral matches using scientific plots

> This project brings **space science and AI** together to answer:  
> 🛸 *"Could we live there?"*

## 📸 Live From Space: How It Works

![jwst](https://media.tenor.com/ZIjUKRVIr1IAAAAC/james-webb-space.gif)

1. JWST captures a spectrogram (light wave breakdown) from a distant exoplanet.
2. The model detects atmospheric features from this data.
3. Earth’s reference spectrum is used as a benchmark.
4. The system calculates a **habitability score** based on similarity.
5. Output includes score, insights, and graphs.
